We move like cagey tigers.
We couldn't get closer than this.
The way we walk.
The way we talk.
The way we stalk.
The way we kiss.
We slip through the streets.
While everyone sleeps.
Getting bigger and sleeker.
And wider and brighter.
We bite and scratch and scream all night.
Let's go and throw.
All the songs we know.
Into the sea
You and me.
All these years and no one heard.
I'll show you in spring.
It's a treacherous thing.
We missed you hissed the lovecats.
We missed you hissed the lovecats.
We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully.
Wonderfully pretty!
Oh you know that I'd do anything for you.
We should have each other to tea huh?
We should have each other with cream.
Then curl up by the fire.
And sleep for awhile.
It's the grooviest thing.
It's the perfect dream.
Into the sea.
